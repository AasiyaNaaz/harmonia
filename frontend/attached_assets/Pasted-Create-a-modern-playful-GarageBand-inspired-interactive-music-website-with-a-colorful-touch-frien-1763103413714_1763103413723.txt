Create a modern, playful, GarageBand-inspired interactive music website with a colorful, touch-friendly UI. The site lets users explore, learn, and interact with music styles—including Pop, Classical, Electronic, Qawalli, Folk.

Site requirements:

Homepage: Friendly welcome, inviting graphics, great color. Briefly explain what the app does (learn various music genres, and play instruments virtually).

Learn/Explore Styles: “Learn a Style” page lists: Pop, Classical, Electronic, Qawalli, Folk. Clicking a style reveals:

Brief history & main characteristics of the style.

Notable artists in that field (list and portrait/photo).

Most popular instruments in that style (with pro-quality images).

“How to use this instrument” animated/tutorial section.

Listen button for each, with a sample audio demo of the instrument.

GarageBand-style studio page: vibrant, fun interactive section emulating a real music studio:

Piano with glowing keys.

Electric and acoustic guitar with animating strings.

Drums with realistic drum kit visuals and areas; tapping each area produces the respective sound like the real instrument.

Bass, synth, and world instruments (e.g. koto, erhu, taiko) with touch effects.

Microphone with live vocal FX (use pre-built audio demos if live is not possible).

Smart virtual instruments—auto chords, drum machines, and interactive pads.

Record - Play - Loop - FX - Tempo - Tracks - Instruments buttons, playful icons.

Cute message: “Tap any instrument to learn and play!”

Animations: Keys light up, strings vibrate, drums bounce, notes float up, soft neon glows, and animated waveforms that move with input.

UI Style: Friendly and rounded (like GarageBand/iPad), soft neon gradients, 3D/2.5D instrument visuals. Modern, clean nav and all sections feel like a game.

User flows: On any instrument, user can (1) tap to play, (2) see brief pop-up history/tips, (3) listen to style-appropriate samples, (4) record or mix simple ideas.

Include instrument/genre-changing navigation, so a user can go:
Home → Pick Style → Explore Style details → Try or Play GarageBand page for that style.

Everything must feel interactive, musical, lively, fun—NOT dry or classroom-like.

Add prominent call to action for learning and engagement: “Try exploring your favorite instrument and style!”

Design/branding:

Energetic, musical, professional visuals.

Each music style has its own color/vibe for its subpages.

Animations and micro-interactions throughout.

All images and samples legal/free for use, or use public domain placeholders.

Key features to request in the prompt:

Modern React (with Vite or Next.js), TypeScript, TailwindCSS for styling (match your stack).

Fully responsive friendly UI for desktop and mobile.

Include rich image assets, icons, and audio samples, easy to swap or update.

A super interactive Drum Kit with clickable and visually realistic drums producing real drum sounds for each hit area.

GarageBand-style interactive studio UI fully playable for every instrument and style.
